## The Process and What I have learned

### The Process
<p>
  I created this script because I wanted to download a few videos from YouTube.
</p>

### Lesson Learned
<p>
Finally, I added the new interface and improve the downloader. I first created this project a few months ago, so I didn't remember exactly how I started it, so it was a bit challenging to read my code again and see what I did there. 
</p>
<p>
Previously, I only used PyTube and scrape the title and video id to download the videos using the urllib library, but I found I could get more information about the video using the API, so I updated it.
</p>
<p>  
Since the YouTube output data is in JSON format, I needed to break it down to get the right information. Also, I had a bit of a challenging time creating a nested dictionary. Also, there was an unexpected bug in PyTube, so I had to fix it accordingly.
</p>
<p>  
In conclusion, now a user can search for any YouTube videos and select the video to download, instead of downloading the first video.
